***Le Monde de Hub'eau***


This project was made for making our group work on the API system. Especially with the API REST type that was necessary for us to use for doing our project.
It was essentially taking back infos from a naval center ( for our project, it was located in the city of Nantes(France)) and we were collecting datas from it.

We choose to add an animation with the water flow for having a visual lecture of our data.

Time for realisation : 7 days.
Size of the group : 3pers.

Mention : @Violaine Darrenti√®res
          @Audrey Gueguen


A gif will be add soon for a visual effect of the project
